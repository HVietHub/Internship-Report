### Week 9 Achievements:

- Built a complete Data Lake on AWS, including S3 storage, Glue cataloging, Kinesis delivery streams, Athena queries, SageMaker notebooks, and QuickSight visualizations.

- Strengthened NoSQL skills through hands-on DynamoDB labs, exploring CLI operations, backups, relational modeling patterns, and zero-ETL integrations with OpenSearch and Amazon Bedrock.

- Learned and applied advanced DynamoDB design patterns, including capacity planning, partitioning, parallel scans, write sharding, sparse indexes, composite keys, adjacency lists, and stream processing.

- Implemented Change Data Capture (CDC) workflows for DynamoDB using both DynamoDB Streams and Kinesis Data Streams.

- Gained strong practical experience in data engineering, NoSQL data modeling, real-time data processing, and analytics on AWS.
