### Week 6 Achievements:

- Gained advanced skills in IAM by implementing conditional role access (IP, time), creating users, groups, and admin roles, and validating secure role switching.

- Learned how to securely grant application access to AWS services by replacing access keys with IAM roles on EC2.

- Strengthened understanding of AWS database services including RDS, Aurora, Redshift, and ElastiCache.

- Successfully deployed a full RDS environment (VPC, security groups, EC2, DB instance) and performed application deployment plus backup/restore operations.

- Completed end-to-end database schema conversion and migration workflows for MSSQL→Aurora MySQL and Oracle→MySQL using SCT and DMS, including troubleshooting and event monitoring.
