### Week 10 Achievements:

- Successfully built and deployed a global serverless application using DynamoDB Global Tables, gaining hands-on experience with multi-Region architecture and event-driven pipelines with fault tolerance and exactly-once processing.

- Strengthened DynamoDB data-modeling skills through game player data modeling, covering user profiles, game sessions, open/closed games, and historical queries.

- Gained deeper experience with AWS Glue & Athena by performing database preparation, ETL operations, querying, cost analysis, tagging, and cost allocation for analytics workloads.

- Improved DynamoDB operational skills using Management Console, CloudShell, AWS CLI, and Python SDK (boto3).

- Built a full data lake pipeline end-to-end: data preparation, Glue ingestion, Athena query optimization, and QuickSight visualization.
