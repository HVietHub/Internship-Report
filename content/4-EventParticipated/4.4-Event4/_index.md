## Event Overview

Workshop exploring how to build modern Data Science systems on AWS, from data processing to ML model deployment.

### Key Topics

**Introduction & AWS Data Science Pipeline (9:30 – 10:05 AM)**

- **Why Cloud for Data Science:**
  - Optimize performance and reduce costs
  - Scale flexibly with demand
  - Access to latest hardware (GPUs, TPUs)
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model

- **AWS Data Science Ecosystem:**
  - **Amazon S3**: Scalable data lake storage
  - **AWS Glue**: Serverless ETL service
  - **Amazon SageMaker**: End-to-end ML platform

**Demo 1: Data Processing with AWS Glue (10:05 – 10:35 AM)**

- **IMDb Dataset Processing:**
  - Data discovery with Glue Crawler
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Text preprocessing and feature extraction
  - Format conversion (CSV to Parquet)
  - PySpark for distributed processing

- **Key Benefits:**
  - Serverless, auto-scaling
  - Pay only for job execution time
  - Built-in data catalog
  - Integration with AWS services

**Demo 2: Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker (10:35 – 11:00 AM)**

- **ML Workflow:**
  - Data preparation and EDA
  - Model selection and training
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Model deployment as endpoint
  - Real-time inference testing

- **Results:**
  - 90%+ accuracy on test set
  - Low latency predictions
  - Auto-scaling for production
  - Cost-effective deployment

**Cloud vs On-Premise Discussion (11:00 – 11:35 AM)**

- **Cost Comparison:**
  - Small projects: Cloud 60-70% cheaper
  - No upfront hardware investment
  - Pay-as-you-go reduces waste

- **Performance:**
  - Access to latest hardware
  - Distributed computing capabilities
  - Global infrastructure

- **Flexibility:**
  - Scale up/down in minutes
  - No capacity planning needed
  - Easy experimentation

**Post-Workshop Project (11:35 – 11:45 AM)**

- Build complete Data Science pipeline
- Suggested projects: Product review analyzer, stock predictor, churn prediction
- 4-week implementation timeline
