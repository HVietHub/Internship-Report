## Event Overview

Full-day workshop covering DevOps culture, AWS CI/CD services, and Infrastructure as Code practices.

### Key Topics

**DevOps Mindset (8:30 – 9:00 AM)**
- DevOps culture and principles
- DORA metrics: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, Change Failure Rate
- Benefits: Faster delivery, lower failure rates, quicker recovery

**AWS CI/CD Pipeline (9:00 – 10:30 AM)**
- **CodeCommit**: Git-based source control
- **CodeBuild**: Automated build and test
- **CodeDeploy**: Deployment strategies
  - Blue/Green: Zero downtime, instant rollback
  - Canary: Gradual rollout with monitoring
  - Rolling: Cost-effective batch updates
- **CodePipeline**: End-to-end orchestration
- Live demo: Complete CI/CD pipeline

**Infrastructure as Code (10:45 AM – 12:00 PM)**
- **CloudFormation**: AWS-native IaC with templates
  - Declarative YAML/JSON
  - Stack management and drift detection
- **AWS CDK**: Programming language approach
  - TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go
  - Higher-level constructs and reusable patterns
- Live demo: Deploying with both tools

## Key Takeaways

**DevOps Culture:**
- Cultural transformation, not just tools
- DORA metrics provide objective measurement
- Elite performers deploy 208x more frequently

**CI/CD Best Practices:**
- Automate source, build, test, deploy stages
- Choose deployment strategy based on use case
- Implement proper testing at each stage
- Use manual approvals for production

**IaC Implementation:**
- CloudFormation for AWS-native declarative IaC
- CDK for programming language approach with type safety
- Version control all infrastructure code
- Implement drift detection

**Next Steps:**
- Measure current DORA metrics
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for key application
- Convert infrastructure to IaC (CloudFormation or CDK)
- Pursue AWS DevOps certification
